						<h2>Scrum is...</h2>
            <p>
              A methodology that allows each team member to work concurrently, 
              in a horizontal hierachical structure, that allows each member of 
              the team to get on with their job.
            </p>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>In English, Scrum is a tool that lets you figure out how to
              get all of your staff to work on the project all at the same
              time. No more waiting, no more struggling with chinese whispers
              as work is passed down the chain.</p>

            <p>In the programming world, there are broadly two ways to build a
            program.</p>

            <p>You can compile a program from source every time you make a
            change. This requires you to hope and pray that you didn't make
            any errors, because you won't find out until you compile, and that
            might take 5-10 minutes if you've got a big project. If you're not
            a very experienced programmer, that's a lot of wasted time.</p>

            <p>However there are other lanaguages which support something called REPL.
            These allow you to conduct small tests on things you are unsure about and
            receive an instant response. This helps speed up development, which makes everyone
            happier.</p>

            <p>Product backlog is a list of tasks you need to do. You break up big chunks into smaller tasks, and then prioritise them.</p>
            <p>We'll talk about how to do this the scrum way later.</p>
            <p>Once we have a backlog, we decide what work we will include into the sprint, and in which order. These tasks will be taken out
            of the product backlog and are locked into the timeline.</p>
            <p>The sprint then occurs (normally it's a 2 week thing in software, ignore this diagram), which is when the team work to complete the tasks.</p>
            <p>Every day there's a feedback loop coming from daily short standup meetings (standups) which help the whole team communicate progress &amp; barriers.</p>
            <p>The mindset of scrum is to always be shipping, so all sprints should end up with a stable, shippable product.</p>

              <li>The team then figure out how to achieve the task, and how

            <p>Every team member should ask 3 things:</p>

              <p>In large companies, having 7 people to one project is not
